# Leaf Spot Detection Using TensorFlow and Keras

## Introduction
Leaf spots are localized, discolored, and diseased areas on leaves caused by various factors such as fungal, bacterial, or viral plant diseases, as well as environmental conditions, toxicity, or herbicide injuries. Detecting and diagnosing these spots accurately can help in early treatment and prevention of plant diseases.

This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for image processing to classify and detect leaf spots. The model was trained on a dataset of leaf images and achieved an impressive **97% accuracy** on the test set.

## Overview
The project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Images are preprocessed and augmented to enhance model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: A deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras, optimized for image classification.
- **Evaluation**: The model achieves high accuracy, making it reliable for detecting leaf spot diseases.

Technologies used:
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Image Processing**: For preprocessing and augmenting leaf images.
- **Python**: As the primary programming language.

This project serves as a practical solution for detecting and classifying leaf spots, aiding researchers, farmers, and agricultural experts in early identification and management of plant diseases.
